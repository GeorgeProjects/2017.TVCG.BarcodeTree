**Background:** 
There are over 300 different tree visualizations according to treevis.net. 
The most appropriate tree visualization to use may change during a single user session (as tasks change) or from one subtree to another of the same tree (as a function of local characteristics).
When visualizing hierarchical data to finish specific tasks, users need to find the tree visualization which can meet their requirements. 

Users select one traditional visualization technique to get the visualization result at first,
then they may find that this technique is unsatisfied from some aspects, 
next they need to change current tree visualizations slightly. 

Therefore, from the above example, users need to explore the alternative of the tree visualizations. 

However, users cannot know how to change the tree visualizations and which aspects of tree visualizations they can change during this procedure. 

\\
**Motivation:** The motivation of this work is to build a framework for all the visualizations to support explore their variants easily.\\
\\
\\
**Challenge:** The major challenge of this work is that feature space of tree visualizations is very large and the framework need to be generic to these visualizations.
\\
Comparing to the animation among different tree visualizations, transformation stresses that the variant results of tree visualizations.
