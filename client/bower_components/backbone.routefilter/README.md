# Backbone Routefilter

Before and after filters for Backbone.Router. Useful for doing things like client side content not found pagesâ€“ any time you want to do something to every route before or after it's routed, this is a good way to do it.

## Overview
Backbone.routefilter works by overriding `Backbone.Router.prototype.route`. Whenever a router's `route` method is called, Backbone.routefilter wraps the route callback (or route handler) that's passed in a 'wrapper handler', that calls whatever `before` or `after` "filters" you have written along with the original route callback.

Because `Backbone.Router.prototype.route` is used internally to bind routes to `Backbone.history`, in addition to being available publicly for ad hoc route handling, Backbone.routefilter will work for you any way you choose to consume `Backbone.Router`.

### Route handling and filtering from a router constructor

You can specify filters in one of two ways:

#### A single function for before/after

```
var Router = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index",
    "page/:id": "page"
  },
  before: function( route, params ) { ... },
  after: function( route, params ) { ... },
  index: function(){ ... },
  page: function( route ){ ... }
});
```

#### An object with routes and their callbacks

```
var Router = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index",
    "page/:id": "page"
  },
  before: {
    "": function( route ) { ... },
    "page/:id": function( route ) { ... }
  },
  after: function( route ) { ... },
  index: function(){ ... },
  page: function( route ){ ... }
});
```

### Ad hoc route handling and filtering

```
var router = new Router();

router.before = function( route, params ) { ... }

router.route("page/:id", "page", function( route ) { ... });
```

### Route Parameters

The second argument to any filter function is an array of the parameter values. So if your route looks like: `page/:id/users/:userid`, and you trigger route: `page/12/users/100`, then your params variable will be set to: [12, 100].

Note if you are specifying your filters per route rather than a single callback, do not overwrite it by calling `router.before = function...` since it will overwrite the entire object you've defined including all other routes! In that case, just define the specific route that you want to add a filter to like so:

`router.before["page/:id"] = function( route ) { ... }`

### Returning false from within a before filter

If you return false from within a `before` filter, neither the route's handler, nor the after filter will be run will run. This is useful if you want to catch, say, a bad route, and prevent the router from actually trying to route it. For example:

```
router.before = function( route, params ) {
  if( !myAcceptableRoutes.indexOf( route ) ){
    return false;
  }
}
```

### What happens if my route doesn't have a handler?

Backbone supports binding routes to route names without actually supplying a route handler callback. Doing so causes Backbone to just dispatch a `route:[name]` event on the router where the name was matched. If you've written `before` or `after` filters, they _will_ be called when any route is matched, whether or not it has a handler callback.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt). In addition to ensuring that your contributions do not introduces regressions by running the Backbone.routefilter tests, please also take the time to run your contributions against the entire Backbone unit test suite.

### Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!

While grunt can run the included unit tests via PhantomJS, this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.

### Installing grunt
_This assumes you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed already._

1. Test that grunt is installed globally by running `grunt --version` at the command-line.
1. If grunt isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt` to install the latest version. _You may need to run `sudo npm install -g grunt`._
1. From the root directory of this project, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

### Installing PhantomJS

In order for the qunit task to work properly, [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/) must be installed and in the system PATH (if you can run "phantomjs" at the command line, this task should work).

Unfortunately, PhantomJS cannot be installed automatically via npm or grunt, so you need to install it yourself. There are a number of ways to install PhantomJS.

* [PhantomJS and Mac OS X](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/02/phantomjs-and-mac-os-x.html)
* [PhantomJS Installation](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation) (PhantomJS wiki)

Note that the `phantomjs` executable needs to be in the system `PATH` for grunt to see it.
